# Security report policy

Security flaws shouldn't be public reported until they are fixed. Documenting a
security breach is necessary but either provide such an _"official"_ guide on
how to exploit a confirmed failure.

While discussing and investigating and fixing security issues, they shall
remain private, protected against any malicious agent.

You might reach me at my [keybase-cripted chat](https://keybase.io/oliveiraev)
in order to discuss a possible security failure and, of course, offer help like
suggestions, how to replicate it, your env, et all.
